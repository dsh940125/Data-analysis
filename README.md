# Data-analysis

### LCGA - ARS longitudinal.R & LCGA.SAS
Using SAS PROC TRAJ package to conduct latent class growth analysis (LCGA) based on Acquiescent Response Style (ARS) patterns over time.

### LCA - Item nonresponse rate
Calculate item nonresponse rate for all the variables (over 6000) in 2004 Health Retirement Study. Find out the highest 21 variables. Conduct latent class analysis (LCA) based on the nonresponse rate for these 21 variables. A seven-class model turns out to be a best fit for the data. Classify variables into difficult and sensitive categories, and collapse variables in the seven-class model. Because of the low entropy, we collapse the seven classes into three to make the patterns clearer. Finally, we conclude that there are three latent classes based on item nonresponse rate for difficult and sensitive questions: 1. Low rate in both questions; 2. High rate in difficult but low rate in sensitive 3. Low rate in difficult but high rate in sensitive.

### LCA - health
Conduct latent class analysis to find out latent classes of respondents based on their answers to five health-related questions.
